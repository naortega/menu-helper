# Menu Helper

A program to manage a database of recipes and help you to pick out meals based
on filters of ingredients and tags.

## Usage

Ensure the `XDG_DATA_HOME` variable is set (e.g. to `$HOME/.local/share`).

## Building

To build the program you will require the following dependencies:

- A C++ compiler compatible with C++20 (preferably GCC).
- SQLite3 C/C++ library
- Make

Once installed, compile the project with the `make` command.

## Contributing

If you find any issues, feel free to report them on GitHub or send me an E-Mail
(see my website/profile for the address). I will add these issues to my personal
Gitea page and (unless specified otherwise) mention you as the person who found
the issue.

For patches/pull requests, if you open a PR on GitHub I will likely not merge
directly but instead apply the patches locally (via Git patches, conserving
authorship), push them to my Gitea repository, which will finally be mirrored to
GitHub. However, you can save me a bit of work by just sending me the Git
patches directly (via E-Mail).

If you're looking for a way to contribute, consider having a look at my [To-Do
list](/TODO.md) for the project.
